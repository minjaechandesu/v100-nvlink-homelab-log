# V100 NVLink Homelab Log

## Overview
This repository documents a personal homelab project using NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2 GPUs with NVLink.

The project started from pure curiosity after discovering OEM NVLink boards circulating in China.
It is not a commercial or ROI-driven setup, but a hands-on engineering log focused on learning
datacenter GPU hardware and scientific computing workflows.

## Hardware Summary
- GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2
- NVLink: OEM NVLink bridge
- Environment: Home lab (non-datacenter)

## Goals
- Practical experience with datacenter-grade GPUs
- Understanding NVLink topology and behavior
- Learning multi-GPU scientific computing workflows

## Notes
This repository is intended as an engineering log and reproducibility reference,
not as a performance benchmark or production guide.
