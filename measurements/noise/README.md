## Measurement Setup
- Device: iPhone 16 Pro
- App: Decibel X
- Weighting: A-weighted
- Response: Fast (0.2s)
- Environment: Home lab, idle state

## Results
- Average (Leq): ~32 dB
- Min: ~31 dB
- Max: ~35 dB
- Peak: ~37 dB

This measurement was taken to evaluate the feasibility of operating
datacenter-grade GPUs (V100 SXM2 with NVLink) in a home environment.
Measured noise levels are comparable to a quiet indoor room.
